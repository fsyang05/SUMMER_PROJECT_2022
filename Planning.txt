Planning

Week 1 Goals (5/30 - 6/5)
- Ensure everybody has access to GitHub repository, Slack channels, coding environment, etc.
- Finalize idea, plan next few weeks
- Identify challenges, goals, checkpoints

- Start learning whatever we need to learn


General Outline

Frontend:
- Mobile application (preferably available on iOS and Android)
- Features:
    - Restaurant search bar
    - Display restaurant information (location, phone, hours, etc.)
    - Reservation / calling buttons
    - Saving restaurants / recently accessed restaurants (maybe)
    - Using AI to search for restaurants users might be interested in (maybe)
    - Account creation (maybe)
- We can use a mobile app builder such as Azure Mobile Apps

Backend:
- Up-to-date database of restaurants (Oracle, SQL Server), we can fill database using information from Yelp API
- Pulls relevant restaurant information (SQL server using Python using pyodbc, pandas to extract)
- Allows users to make reservations, sends requests to restaurants to make reservation (hosting our own server to allow requests?)
- Allows users to search using restaurant names (later on we can incorporate keywords, price, location, etc. as filters)
