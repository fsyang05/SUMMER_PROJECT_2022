Brainstorming

Current ideas:
- Application that tracks symptoms for patients and creates databases accessible to hospitals, doctors
- Application for landlords that tracks properties and performs certain actions
- Similar to above, an restaurant application for reservations, ordering, etc
- Recipe search service; database of recipes, users can search using filters and keywords

Goals:
- Make something cool
- Money?
