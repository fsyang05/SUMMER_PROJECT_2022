Brainstorming

Current ideas:
1. Application that tracks symptoms for patients and creates databases accessible to hospitals, doctors
2. Application for landlords that tracks properties and performs certain actions
3. Similar to above, an restaurant application for reservations, ordering, etc
4. Recipe search service; database of recipes, users can search using filters and keywords
5. Day planner (routine + reminders)

Goals:
- Make something cool
- Money?
